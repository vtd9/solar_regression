# solar_regression

Deep learning assignment:

"Find the fundamental parameters that determine the onset of energy dissipation in the solar wind. 

Determine whether the conjectured formula from the independent variables (or equivalently, the derived variables) is correct or not. In order to do that, in addition to coming up with a neural network to fit the data, compute the derivatives of the dependent variable against all the other variables."
